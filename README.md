4. Open up `DebugCompiler.exe` and type the letter **I**.
5. Drag and drop the GSC file on top of the black window, this should automatically paste the filepath for the GSC file into the window. If you prefer, you can just manually type the path.
6. Press Enter and you should see some green text that ends with "Injected", as per the image below.
