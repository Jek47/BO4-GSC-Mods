# How to use the PS4 GSC injector
0. First of all, your PS4 needs to be jailbroken and running the latest version of GoldHEN to use these mods. Look up [ModdedWarfare](https://www.youtube.com/@MODDEDWARFARE) tutorials on YouTube if you need help jailbreaking the console.
   Also, this has only been tested on FW 9.00, so if you're on a lower firmware this may or may not work for you.

1. On your PS4, go to `Settings` > `GoldHEN` > `Servers Settings` > and make sure that `Enable BinLoader Server` is ticked.   
2. Download the [PS4 GSC injector](https://github.com/Jek47/BO4-GSC-Mods/blob/main/Injectors/PS4/BO4%20GSC%20Injector%20%5BPS4%5D.zip).
3. [Download](https://github.com/Jek47/BO4-GSC-Mods/tree/main/Zombies%20Mods) the GSC file for the mod you want to play.
4. Make sure that Black Ops 4 **is not** running, then open up `PlayStation 4 Tool Box v2.exe` (running the game first will make the console crash).
5. In the top-left corner of the toolbox, type the IP address of your PS4 and the port number: `9090`, then click the white envelope button (circled in red).

   Two things should happen at this point; you should get a notification on your PS4 saying: `Frame4 by DeathRGH & DizzRL Update 0.1.1`, also the status bar in the bottom-left of the toolbox should now say: `âœ… Payload injected successfully!`

   If your console crashes at this point, just keep trying. Frame4 isn't very stable so it might take a few attempts.

6. Now launch Black Ops 4 and go to the in-game menu relevant to the mode that the mod has been made for (don't actually start a game yet).

   Example; if you want to inject a zombies mod, make sure you're on the zombies menu:

7. In the toolbox, go to: `Game Tools` > `Call of Duty` > `Black Ops 4` > `1.26` > `GSC Injector`

8. From here, click the `Attach` button. You should get another notification on your PS4 to confirm this action.
9. Now click the `Inject` button and browse to the GSC file you downloaded in step 3.
10. You should now see a message that says your mod was injected successfully.

If you see this message, your mod should load in when you start the match. 

If you want to remove the mod, simply close the game and restart it.
