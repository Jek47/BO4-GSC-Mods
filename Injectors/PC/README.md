# How to inject GSC on PC
1. Download the [PC GSC injector]([https://github.com/Jek47/BO4-GSC-Mods/tree/main/Injectors/PC](https://github.com/Jek47/BO4-GSC-Mods/blob/main/Injectors/PC/BO4%20GSC%20Injector%20%5BPC%5D.zip)).
2. [Download](https://github.com/Jek47/BO4-GSC-Mods/tree/main/Zombies%20Mods) the GSC file for the mod you want to play.
3. Make sure that you are on the correct in-game menu relevant to the mode that the mod has been made for (not actually in-game yet).

   Example; if you want to inject a zombies mod, make sure you're on the zombies menu:

4. Open up `DebugCompiler.exe` and type the letter `I`.
5. Drag and drop the GSC file on top of the black window, this should automatically paste the filepath for the GSC file into the window.

   If you prefer, you can just manually type the filepath.
   
6. Press `Enter` and you should see some green text that ends with `Injected`, as per the image below.

If you see this text, your mod should load in when you start the match. 

If you want to remove the mod, simply close the game and restart it.
