# Narrative Rooms
This mod allows to you to enter the "Super Easter Egg" rooms on all the zombies maps.\
As seen in my videos on Youtube: ([Voyage of Despair](https://youtube.com/watch?v=81FOtzzDNjk) and [IX](https://youtube.com/watch?v=qxqq84LOukw))

The rooms are referred to as either `narrative_room` or `lore_room` in the game's code, depending on the map. 

All this mod does is opens the room on each map and renders it in.
